# about the lion
i've found the information in [wikipeida lion article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion)
## important information
1.  The lion is one of the big cats in the Felidae family and a member of genus Panthera.
2.  It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996, as populations in African range countries declined by about 43% since the early 1990s.
3.  In the wilderness, males seldom live longer than 10 to 14 years, as injuries sustained from continual fighting with rival males greatly reduce their life span. In captivity they can live more than 20 years.
4.  A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and a small number of adult males.
5.  Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates.
